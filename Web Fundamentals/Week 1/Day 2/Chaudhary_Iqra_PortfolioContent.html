    <h1> Iqra Chaudhary </h1>
    <p> Hi! My name is Iqra and I'm new to Coding Dojo. Let me tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
    <h2> Professional </h2>
    <p> I studied Childhood Development and have worked with children for about 10 years. 
        Recently, I decided I wanted to change my field and started looking into web development. 
        I'm super excited to be a Coding Dojo Ninja! </p>
    <h2> Personal </h2>
    <p> My favorite pastime is cooking fun recipes I find online! 
        I also love being with family and hanging out with my friends. 
        I do my best to make plans to travel as often as I can -- I LOVE traveling!</p>
    <div>
        <p> Some of the places I've travelled to:
            <ul> 
                <li> New York City, New York </li>

    <p> One of my favorite things to do in each city is find a local restaurant to enjoy with my friends.
        Here is a table of some of the best restaurants I found:
